Build multiple linear regression model to predict sales of a store given number of customers, open, promo, state holiday, school holiday, day of week, week of month and month of year? 
Answered the following questions; 

Level 1
●	Build multiple linear regression model to predict sales of a store given number of customers, open, promo, state holiday, school holiday, day of week, week of month and month of year
●	What are the variables that are statistically significant in the model ?
●	What is R Square and Adjusted R square of the model ? 

Level 2
●	What happens to R Square as you remove outliers ? Why ?
●	What happens to R Square as you increase variables ? Why ?
●	What happens to Adjusted R Square as you increase the number of variables ?


Level 3
●	What is predicted sale of a store when 1000 customers visit when store is open, when there is promotion, when it is a state holiday and school holiday on Aug5,2015. Use the model constructed above.
●	Do feature selection/ variable selection using stepwise selection algorithm


Goal
●	By the end of this assignment you should be familiar in and out of linear regression and lm function in R.
●	You should understand R square and Adjusted R Square, their difference and how they get effected when more features/variables are added, when outliers removed etc
●	You should understand the Pvalues and their interpretations
●	Step wise feature selection method
